    "# Intro to Zarr\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides a brief introduction to Zarr and how to\n",
    "use it in cloud environments for scalable, chunked, and compressed data storage.\n",
    "Zarr is a file format with implementations in different languages. In this tutorial, we will look at an example of how to use the Zarr format by looking at some features of the `zarr-python` library and how Zarr files can be opened with `xarray`.\n",

    "## What is Zarr?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Zarr data format is an open, community-maintained format designed for efficient, scalable storage of large N-dimensional arrays. It stores data as compressed and chunked arrays in a format well-suited to parallel processing and cloud-native workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Zarr Data Organization:\n",
    "- **Arrays**: N-dimensional arrays that can be chunked and compressed.\n",
    "- **Groups**: A container for organizing multiple arrays and other groups with a hierarchical structure.\n",
    "- **Metadata**: JSON-like metadata describing the arrays and groups, including information about dimensions, data types, and compression.\n",
    "- **Dimensions and Shape**: Arrays can have any number of dimensions, and their shape is defined by the number of elements in each dimension.\n",
    "- **Coordinates & Indexing**: Zarr supports coordinate arrays for each dimension, allowing for efficient indexing and slicing.\n",
